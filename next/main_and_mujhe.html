<h2>>What is the difference between mujhe and main in Hindi?</h2>

> "main" is subject case only,
"mujhe" is for object cases, and it comes in three versions for different levels of language (style):
"mujhe" (literary and educated), "mujh ko" (everyday usage), and "mere ko" (substandard, but also widely used)

>  "mujhe" and "main" both refer to the self, but they are used in different contexts. "Mujhe" is used to express that something is happening to or for the speaker, while "main" is used to refer to the speaker as the subject of a sentence. For example, "Mujhe khana pasand hai" means "I like food," while "Main khana kha raha hoon" means "I am eating food."
